# Tiago Silva - Date_Analyst_Portfolio
## About Me
My name is Tiago Silva, I am 22 years old, and I live in Braga, Portugal. I completed high school with a focus on Socioeconomic Sciences, where I developed a strong foundation in economics, sociology, and applied mathematics. Currently, I work as a store operator at Continente Nova Arcada, where I am responsible for ensuring customer satisfaction through efficient and friendly service.

Although I enjoy my current job, my true passion lies in technology. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the innovative potential of gadgets and new digital tools. This passion led me to invest in continuous learning, and I am currently taking courses in data analysis. I believe that the ability to interpret and effectively use data is a crucial skill in the modern world, and I am committed to developing my expertise in this field.

In my free time, I enjoy playing PlayStation, hanging out with friends, and playing football. I greatly value time spent around the table with friends and family, as I consider these moments essential for strengthening bonds and creating lasting memories.

I am a curious and determined person, always seeking to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. My goal is to join a technology team in the future, where I can apply my data analysis knowledge and contribute to the development of innovative solutions.
